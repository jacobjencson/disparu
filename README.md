# disparu

This is the code for Disparu, the candidate scanning page for an HST search 
for failed SNe. The page interacts with the Disparu database (PostgreSQL), 
and allows for the filtering and scanning of candidates detected in 
difference imaging. The software is primarily authored by Jacob Jencson
with lots of help and advice from Phil Daly.
